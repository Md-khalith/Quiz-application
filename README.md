## üéØ Description of the Task

This project is a **simple interactive quiz application** built using core front-end technologies ‚Äî **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The primary goal of this application is to offer a dynamic and enjoyable way to test basic knowledge of web development, particularly focused on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts.

The application begins with a playful welcome screen prompting the user to ‚ÄúStart Quiz.‚Äù Upon clicking, the main quiz interface is revealed. The quiz presents **ten multiple-choice questions**, each with four options. Users receive **instant feedback** after each selection ‚Äî the feedback text changes based on whether the selected answer is correct or not, adding both personality and learning value to the experience.

Each correct answer contributes to the user‚Äôs total score, and a ‚ÄúNext‚Äù button allows progression through the quiz. After all questions are answered, a final screen displays the user‚Äôs score, along with a ‚ÄúReset Quiz‚Äù button to replay and attempt a better result.

This project showcases your understanding of **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, **conditional logic**, and **dynamic styling** with a strong emphasis on user experience and aesthetic design.

## üíª Languages Used

- **HTML5** ‚Äì Used to structure the content and layout of the web application.
- **CSS3** ‚Äì Applied to style the user interface with gradients, layout design, hover effects, and responsive visuals.
- **JavaScript (ES6)** ‚Äì Handles interactivity, question logic, answer validation, score tracking, feedback display, and UI transitions.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies Used

- **Vanilla JavaScript** ‚Äì No frameworks or libraries were used. All logic was written in clean, beginner-friendly JavaScript.
- **HTML & CSS** ‚Äì The building blocks of the front-end, used to construct and beautify the page.
- **Browser Developer Tools** ‚Äì Utilized for real-time testing, inspecting DOM elements, and debugging script behavior.
- **Live Server Extension** (VS Code) ‚Äì Used to preview and test the application in real-time during development.

---

## üß∞ Editor Platform Used

The entire project was developed using **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** ‚Äî a powerful and popular source-code editor developed by Microsoft. It offers a robust set of features such as syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, and an integrated terminal.

VS Code extensions that enhanced the development process:
- **Live Server** ‚Äì for live reloading and previewing the quiz in the browser
- **Prettier** ‚Äì to keep the code clean and consistently formatted
- **JavaScript IntelliSense** ‚Äì for hints and autocomplete

VS Code was chosen for its flexibility, customization options, and developer-friendly interface, making it ideal for building responsive, interactive front-end applications like this one.
